  Abstract =	 {Accessing knowledge of a single knowledge source
                  with different client applications often requires
                  the help of mediator systems as middleware
                  components. In the domain of theorem proving large
                  efforts have been made to formalize knowledge for
                  mathematics and verification issues, and to
                  structure it in databases. But these databases are
                  either specialized for a single client, or if the
                  knowledge is stored in a general database, the
                  services this database can provide are usually
                  limited and hard to adjust for a particular theorem
                  prover. Only recently there have been initiatives to
                  flexibly connect existing theorem proving systems
                  into networked environments that contain large
                  knowledge bases. An intermediate layer containing
                  both, search and proving functionality can be used
                  to mediate between the two. In this paper we
                  motivate the need and discuss the requirements for
                  mediators between mathematical knowledge bases and
                  theorem proving systems. We also present an attempt
                  at a concurrent mediator between a knowledge base
                  and a proof planning system.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper discusses an agent based approach to
                  automated and interactive reasoning. It combines
                  ideas from two subfields of AI (theorem
                  proving/proof planning and multi-agent systems) and
                  makes use of state of the art distribution
                  techniques to decentralise and spread its reasoning
                  agents over the internet. The approach particularly
                  supports cooperative proofs between reasoning agents
                  which are strong in different applications areas,
                  e.g., higher-order and first-order theorem provers
                  and computer algebra systems.},

  Abstract =	 {Freek Wiedijk proposed the well-known theorem about
                  the irrationality of sqrt{2} as a case study and
                  used this theorem for a comparison of fifteen
                  (interactive) theorem proving systems, which were
                  asked to present their solution. This represents an
                  important shift of emphasis in the field of
                  automated deduction away from the somehow artificial
                  problems of the past as represented, for example, in
                  the test set of the TPTP library back to real
                  mathematical challenges. In this paper we present an
                  overview of the OMEGA system as far as it is
                  relevant for the purpose of this paper and show the
                  development of a proof for this theorem.},

                  resolution calculus that is complete relative to
                  Henkin model semantics. The treatment of the
                  extensionality principles -- necessary for the
                  completeness result -- by specialized
                  (goal-directed) inference rules is of practical
                  applicability, as an implentation of the calculus in
                  the LEO-System shows. Furthermore, we prove the
                  long-standing conjecture, that it is sufficient to
                  restrict the order of primitive substitutions to the
                  order of input formulae.},

  Abstract =	 {The acceptance and usability of current interactive
                  theorem proving environments is, among other things,
                  strongly influenced by the availability of an
                  intelligent default suggestion mechanism for
                  commands. Such mechanisms support the user by
                  decreasing the necessary interactions during the
                  proof construction. Although many systems offer such
                  facilities, they are often limited in their
                  functionality. In this paper we present a new
                  agent-based mechanism that independently observes
                  the proof state, steadily computes suggestions on
                  how to further construct the proof, and communicates
                  these suggestions to the user via a graphical user
                  interface. We furthermore introduce a focus
                  technique in order to restrict the search space when
                  deriving default suggestions. Although the agents we
                  discuss in this paper are rather simple from a
                  computational viewpoint, we indicate how the
                  presented approach can be extended in order to
                  increase its deductive power.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper presents two approaches to primitive
                  equality treatment in higher-order (HO) automated
                  theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$ adapting
                  traditional first-order (FO)
                  paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and a calculus
                  $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO
                  RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO logic (based
                  on Church's simply typed
                  $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$ and $\EXTRUE$ extend
                  the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach
                  Henkin completeness without the need for additional
                  extensionality axioms both calculi employ new,
                  positive extensionality rules analogously to the
                  respective negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that
                  operate on unification constraints. As the
                  extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO
                  paramodulation approach looses its pure
                  term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise
                  rather well with the difference-reducing HO
                  RUE-resolution idea.},

  Abstract =	 {We introduce a resource adaptive agent mechanism
                  which supports the user in interactive theorem
                  proving. The mechanism, an extension
                  of~\cite{BeSo98b}, uses a two layered architecture
                  of agent societies to suggest appropriate commands
                  together with possible command argument
                  instantiations. Experiments with this approach show
                  that its effectiveness can be further improved by
                  introducing a resource concept. In this paper we
                  provide an abstract view on the overall mechanism,

                  chosen examples of proofs which use a similar
                  reasoning strategy to prove related theorems, and
                  this strategy could be characterised as a proof
                  method. We propose a representation framework for
                  methods, and a machine learning technique which can
                  learn methods using this representation
                  framework. The technique can be applied (amongst
                  other) to learn whether and when to call external
                  systems such as theorem provers or computer algebra
                  systems. This is work in progress, and we hope to
                  gain useful feedback from the CALCULEMUS community.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper reports on the integration of the
                  higher-order theorem proving environment TPS
                  [Andrews96] into the mathematical assistant OMEGA
                  [Omega97]. TPS can be called from OMEGA either as a
                  black box or as an interactive system. In black box
                  mode, the user has control over the parameters which
                  control proof search in TPS; in interactive mode,
                  all features of the TPS-system are available to the
                  user. If the subproblem which is passed to TPS
                  contains concepts defined in OMEGA's database of
                  mathematical theories, these definitions are not
                  instantiated but are also passed to TPS. Using a
                  special theory which contains proof tactics that
                  model the ND-calculus variant of TPS within OMEGA,
                  any complete or partial proof generated in TPS can
                  be translated one to one into an OMEGA proof
                  plan. Proof transformation is realised by proof plan
                  expansion in OMEGA's 3-dimensional proof data
                  structure, and remains transparent to the user.},

  Abstract =	 {We investigate several approaches to resolution
                  based automated theorem proving in classical
                  higher-order logic (based on Church's simply typed
                  lambda calculus) and discuss their requirements with
                  respect to Henkin completeness and full
                  extensionality. In particular we focus on Andrews'
                  higher-order resolution [Andrews71], Huet's
                  constrained resolution [Huet72], higher-order

                  resolution [BenzmuellerKohlhase98]. With the help of
                  examples we illustrate the parallels and differences
                  of the extensionality treatment of these approaches
                  and demonstrate that extensional higher-order
                  resolution is the sole approach that can completely

                  propose a distributed mediator module between KB and
                  a theorem proving system S which is independent of
                  the particular proof representation format of S and
                  which applies generalized resolution in order to
                  analyze the logical consequences of arbitrary

  Abstract =	 {Research on automated and interactive theorem
                  proving aims at the mechanization of logical
                  reasoning. Aside from the development of logic
                  calculi it became rapidly apparent that the
                  organization of proof search on top of the calculi
                  is an essential task in the design of powerful
                  theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how
                  to organize proof search have emerged in that area
                  of research, the most prominent representatives are
                  generally described by the buzzwords: automated
                  theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof
                  planning. Despite their paradigmatic differences,
                  all approaches share a common goal: to find a proof
                  for a given conjecture. In this paper we start with
                  a rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms
                  in the area of proof planning and tactical theorem
                  proving. Guided by similarities between software
                  engineering and proof construction we develop a
                  uniform view that accommodates the various proof
                  search methodologies and eases their
                  comparison. Based on this view, we propose a unified
                  framework that enables the combination of different
                  methodologies for proof construction to take
                  advantage of their individual virtues within
                  specific phases of a proof construction.},

  Abstract =	 {Garg and Abadi recently proved that prominent access
                  control logics can be translated in a sound and
                  complete way into modal logic S4. We have previously
                  outlined how normal multimodal logics, including
                  monomodal logics K and S4, can be embedded in simple
                  type theory and we have demonstrated that the
                  higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can automate
                  reasoning in and about them. In this paper we
                  combine these results and describe a sound embedding
                  of different access control logics in simple type
                  theory. Employing this framework we show that the
                  off the shelf theorem prover LEO-II can be applied
                  to automate reasoning in prominent access control
                  logics.  },

                  over historians to logicians. Besides the well-known
                  correction of Herbrand's False Lemma by Goedel and

                  Herbrand's Modus Ponens Elimination. Besides
                  Herbrand's Fundamental Theorem and its relation to
                  the Loewenheim-Skolem-Theorem, we carefully
                  investigate Herbrand's notion of intuitionism in
                  connection with his notion of falsehood in an
                  infinite domain. We sketch Herbrand's two proofs of

  Abstract =	 {When mathematicians present proofs they usually
                  adapt their explanations to their didactic goals and
                  to the (assumed) knowledge of their
                  addressees. Modern automated theorem provers, in
                  contrast, present proofs usually at a fixed level of
                  detail (also called granularity). Often these
                  presentations are neither intended nor suitable for
                  human use. A challenge therefore is to develop user-
                  and goal-adaptive proof presentation techniques that
                  obey common mathematical practice. We present a
                  flexible and adaptive approach to proof presentation
                  that exploits machine learning techniques to extract
                  a model of the specific granularity of proof
                  examples and employs this model for the automated
                  generation of further proofs at an adapted level of
                  granularity.},

  Abstract =	 {Most interactive proof development environments are
                  insufficient to handle the complexity of the
                  information to be conveyed to the user and to
                  support his orientation in large-scale proofs. In
                  this paper we present a distributed client-server
                  extension of the OMEGA proof development system,
                  focusing on the LOUI (Lovely OMEGA User Interface)
                  client. This graphical user interface provides
                  advanced communication facilities through an
                  adaptable proof tree visualization and through
                  various selective proof object display methods. Some
                  of LOUI's main features are the graphical display of
                  co-references in proof graphs, a selective term
                  browser, and support for dynamically adding
                  knowledge to partial proofs -- all based upon and

  Abstract =	 {We re-investigate a proof example presented by
                  George Boolos which perspicuously illustrates
                  G\"odel's argument for the potentially drastic
                  increase of proof-lengths in formal systems when
                  carrying through the argument at too low a
                  level. More concretely, restricting the order of the
                  logic in which the proof is carried through to the
                  order of the logic in which the problem is
                  formulated in the first place can result in
                  unmanageable long proofs, although there are short
                  proofs in a logic of higher order. Our motivation in
                  this paper is of practical nature and its aim is to
                  sketch the implications of this example to current
                  technology in automated theorem proving, to point to
                  related questions about the foundational character
                  of type theory (without explicit comprehension
                  axioms) for mathematics, and to work out some
                  challenging aspects with regard to the automation of
                  this proof -- which, as we belief, nicely
                  illustrates the discrepancy between the creativity
                  and intuition required in mathematics and the
                  limitations of state of the art theorem provers.},

                  task. Unlike many other verification methods the
                  approach proposed in [nonnengart99] avoids
                  approximations and operates directly on the original
                  system specifications. This approach, however,
                  requires the solution of non-trivial mathematical

                  subtasks that are suitable for being tackled with
                  reasoning specialists as mathematical service
                  requests to a network of service systems like the

                  following candidates of mathematical service
                  requests: the solution of differential equations,
                  subsumption and consistency of sets of
                  constraints. A further candidate can be the
                  elimination of second order set variables with
                  higher order theorem provers.},

                  well as interactively employed from within the OMEGA

                  into OMEGA on a tactic level enabling their

                  show how \tps\/ proofs can be inserted into OMEGA's

                  using both OMEGA's tactic mechanism and the first

  Abstract =	 {Today's interactive mathematics textbooks use a
                  collection of predefined documents, typically
                  organized as a network of html pages. This makes a
                  reuse and a sound re-combination of the encoded
                  knowledge impossible and inhibits a radical adaption
                  of course presentation and content to the user's
                  needs. In order to avoid these drawbacks we have
                  designed a web-based framework for dynamically
                  producing interactive documents for learning
                  mathematics called ID. The system design relies on
                  the separation of knowledge representation from
                  system functionalities. Salient features of our
                  system are the individual generation of interactive
                  documents based on general domain knowledge,
                  user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge
                  as well as the integration of external problem
                  solving systems. The paper describes the distributed
                  web-based architecture of our system and the
                  principles of its components.},

  Abstract =	 {In this paper we propose how proof planning systems
                  can be extended by an automated learning
                  capability. The idea is that a proof planner would
                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well
                  chosen examples of proofs which use a similar
                  reasoning strategy to prove related theorems, and
                  this strategy could be characterised as a proof
                  method. We propose a representation framework for
                  methods, and a machine learning technique which can
                  learn methods using this representation
                  framework. This is work in progress, and we hope to
                  gain useful feedback from the workshop community.},
